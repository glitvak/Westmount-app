# Westmount Learning App

This was an app I created fully on my own while working at Westmount.

I was asked to see if I'd be able to create an app that can simplify a lot of the websites tasks and also create easier access to the audio class archive they've stored over time.

I decided to use React Native due to me using React before on different projects. 
I ended up creating a well functioning app that displays new news automatically from the company with the class archive fully ordered for easy listenting capabilities.
I also ended up going further with the audio archive idea and created a fully functioning mp3 player that is able to play all the class archives as well as download then for offline listening whenever, wherever. 

There are two stable releases that were created and maintained while I was still working there. 

You can find the app on both the apple app store and google play store.
